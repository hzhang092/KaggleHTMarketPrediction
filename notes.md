### cluster 
The Underlying Hypothesis: You are testing the hypothesis that the market behaves in distinct, identifiable regimes. For example, a "calm bull market" regime might have different predictive patterns than a "volatile bear market" regime. By creating a feature that explicitly identifies the current regime (cluster), you hope to give your CatBoost model a powerful piece of context.
